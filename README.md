# asus-router-eth-guest-vlan
## Motivation ##

After installing a security camera system, which connects to the cloud, I realized that I wasn't a fan of devices that call "home", while having access to my private network.

## Purpose ##

This script segregates port 4 from the private network, without requiring a different subnet, dhcp, dns, etc...


## Requirements ##

Although this was created for an Asus RT-AC68U, the same script or slightly modified verions should work on different vendors/models.

A functional USB drive needs to be connected; Since this leverages a usb mounting function, a mountable USB drive is required to launch the script.  I personally use an old and small flash drive.

See script file itself for firmware version info.

## Install##

See instructions within the script file itself.
